# Symphony Fugue
This project provides a set of abstractions for delivering Symphony 2.0 Services on a cloud service provider. The intention is that these tools will support all cloud platforms on which Symphony operates, but for the moment only Google GCP is supported.

In the examples which follow the project name **sym-dev-arch** is used. Where you see this name in the examples you should substitute the name of the project you are using. To follow the examples you will need access to a cloud service provider project. For Symphony internal projects your tech lead will provide access to the appropriate project and give you the name of the project you should use. Instructions for the creation of accounts with Google, Amazon or other providers are available from those providers, but are outside the scope of this tutorial.

# General Environment Setup
In order to build the sample application you will need a local Docker container. If you do not have a Docker container installed then you can download the Community Edition from [The Docker Store](https://www.docker.com/community-edition).

You will also need a Java8 runtime and Maven installed.

# Next Steps
The next step is to [Set up a Google Cloud Environment](cloudSetup/google/index.md)
